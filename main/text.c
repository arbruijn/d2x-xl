Die von den Servern\nangebotenen Spiele werden dann in der Spieleliste angezeigt.\nDas bedeutet, dass man sich nicht mehr vorab auf IP-Adressen\nund Ports einigen muss und macht es sehr einfach, Multiplayer-\nSpiele anzubieten und daran teilzunehmen.

A tracker is a computer sitting somewhere,\nwaiting for such registration requests, and store the servers'\nIP address and port number in a table. Clients will contact\nall trackers known to them, asking them for any servers that\nhave registered with them and thus automatically find out\nabout available servers and their IP addresses and ports, and\ndisplay the games they offer in the game browser. This means\nyou don't need to communicate IP addresses and port numbers\nahead of playing and makes setting up and joining multiplayer\ngames much more comfortable.
